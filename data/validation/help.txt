Steps of adding a field to data.json configuration file:
1. Adding a field in data_validation.json in this directory. There are
three types of fields:
    1. Required: User must put this field. The program will break if
    miss any required fields.
    2. Warning: User should put this field. There is a default value
    always, but the default value may break the code.
    3. Optional: User may put this field. There is a default value
    always and it's going to be the proper one. This won't break
    anything in the program.
2. Updating examples directory including data.json file.

#1 type.json
Types of fields to be put in the configuration file are:
    1. Required: User must use this field. The program will break if a required field missed.
    2. Warning: User should use this field. The program will warn if a warning field missed. There is always a default value, but it may break the code.
    3. Optional: User may put this field. There is always a default value and it's maybe the proper one. Missing it won't cause the program to either warn or break.
